Expectations of the course
--------------------------

As you can see this course is short and covers a lot of material. The
idea of the course is more to give you a taste of the information and
not a full overview of each technology. In order for the course to be
effective you should do all the exercises and read more about the
technology on your free time. The more code that you write the more you
will learn.

Course Format
-------------

The sessions will be hour each week on hangout. Ever few sessions we
will get together to do the exercise at the office by tikal. All
presentations and information will be available via github.

Previous knowledge
------------------

The assumption is that you have written in a previous language. If the
language is an object oriented language it is an advantage. We will not
focus on architecture thought it will be in the background, and any
knowledge in this area is an advantage.

Pre requisites
--------------

You need to download the following software for the course

1.  [Java JDK 8] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and above (not JRE) â€“ can be found at oracle site.

2.  [Eclipse IDE] (https://eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (my preference) 

3.  Data base -&gt;

Project
-------

The project will be the same one throughout the course. Each class that
we learn we will enhance the project and continue to add to it.

To make thinks simple we will use the domain of motor vehicles and car
rental service.

-   In a rental car service there are people that want to rent cars.

-   There are different types of cars that can be rented out.

-   There should be a service that will give out cars to people
    dependent on some criteria.
